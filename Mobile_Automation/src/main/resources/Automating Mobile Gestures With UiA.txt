Automating Mobile Gestures With UiAutomator2 Backend
Touch actions are the most advanced and the most complicated way to implement any Android gesture. Although, there is a couple of basic gestures, like swipe, fling or pinch, which are commonly used in Android applications and for which it makes sense to have shortcuts, where only high-level options are configurable.

mobile: longClickGesture
This gesture performs long click action on the given element/coordinates. Available since Appium v1.19

Supported arguments
elementId: The id of the element to be clicked. If the element is missing then both click offset coordinates must be provided. If both the element id and offset are provided then the coordinates are parsed as relative offsets from the top left corner of the element.
x: The x-offset coordinate
y: The y-offset coordinate
duration: Click duration in milliseconds. 500 by default. The value must not be negative
Usage examples

((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("mobile: longClickGesture", ImmutableMap.of(
    "elementId", ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId()
));

Supported arguments
elementId: The id of the element to be dragged. If the element id is missing then both start coordinates must be provided. If both the element id and the start coordinates are provided then these coordinates are considered as offsets from the top left element corner.
startX: The x-start coordinate
startY: The y-start coordinate
endX: The x-end coordinate. Mandatory argument
endY: The y-end coordinate. Mandatory argument
speed: The speed at which to perform this gesture in pixels per second. The value must not be negative. The default value is 2500 * displayDensity
Usage examples
// Java
((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("mobile: dragGesture", ImmutableMap.of(
    "elementId", ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId(),
    "endX", 100,
    "endY", 100
));
mobile: flingGesture
This gesture performs fling gesture on the given element/area. Available since Appium v1.19

Supported arguments
elementId: The id of the element to be flinged. If the element id is missing then fling bounding area must be provided. If both the element id and the fling bounding area are provided then this area is effectively ignored.
left: The left coordinate of the fling bounding area
top: The top coordinate of the fling bounding area
width: The width of the fling bounding area
height: The height of the fling bounding area
direction: Direction of the fling. Mandatory value. Acceptable values are: up, down, left and right (case insensitive)
speed: The speed at which to perform this gesture in pixels per second. The value must be greater than the minimum fling velocity for the given view (50 by default). The default value is 7500 * displayDensity
Returned value
The returned value is a boolean one and equals to true if the object can still scroll in the given direction

Usage examples
// Java
boolean canScrollMore = (Boolean) ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("mobile: flingGesture", ImmutableMap.of(
    "elementId", ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId(),
    "direction", "down",
    "speed", 500
));
mobile: pinchOpenGesture
This gesture performs pinch-open gesture on the given element/area. Available since Appium v1.19

Supported arguments
elementId: The id of the element to be pinched. If the element id is missing then pinch bounding area must be provided. If both the element id and the pinch bounding area are provided then the area is effectively ignored.
left: The left coordinate of the pinch bounding area
top: The top coordinate of the pinch bounding area
width: The width of the pinch bounding area
height: The height of the pinch bounding area
percent: The size of the pinch as a percentage of the pinch area size. Valid values must be float numbers in range 0..1, where 1.0 is 100%. Mandatory value.
speed: The speed at which to perform this gesture in pixels per second. The value must not be negative. The default value is 2500 * displayDensity
Usage examples
// Java
((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("mobile: pinchOpenGesture", ImmutableMap.of(
    "elementId", ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId(),

left: The left coordinate of the swipe bounding area
top: The top coordinate of the swipe bounding area
width: The width of the swipe bounding area
height: The height of the swipe bounding area
direction: Swipe direction. Mandatory value. Acceptable values are: up, down, left and right (case insensitive)
percent: The size of the swipe as a percentage of the swipe area size. Valid values must be float numbers in range 0..1, where 1.0 is 100%. Mandatory value.

The `io.appium.java_client.TouchShortcuts` interface in the Appium Java Client provides methods for performing touch actions on mobile devices. Here's an overview of its usage:

1. Import the necessary classes:
```java
import io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver;
import io.appium.java_client.MobileElement;
import io.appium.java_client.TouchAction;
import io.appium.java_client.touch.offset.PointOption;
```

2. Create an instance of the driver:
```java
AppiumDriver<MobileElement> driver = new AppiumDriver<>(/* driver initialization */);
```

3. Cast the driver to `TouchShortcuts`:
```java
TouchShortcuts touchActions = (TouchShortcuts) driver;
```

4. Use the available methods from the `TouchShortcuts` interface. Here are some commonly used methods:

- `tap(int fingers, MobileElement element, int duration)`: Simulates a tap gesture on the specified element.
```java
MobileElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
touchActions.tap(1, element, 1000); // Tap on the element for 1 second
```

- `press(PointOption<?> pointOption)`: Simulates a press gesture at the specified screen coordinates.
```java
PointOption<?> point = PointOption.point(100, 200);
touchActions.press(point).release().perform(); // Press at (100, 200) and release
```

- `longPress(PointOption<?> pointOption, int duration)`: Simulates a long press gesture at the specified screen coordinates for a given duration.
```java
PointOption<?> point = PointOption.point(100, 200);
touchActions.longPress(point, 3000).release().perform(); // Long press at (100, 200) for 3 seconds and release
```

- `doubleTap(MobileElement element)`: Simulates a double tap gesture on the specified element.
```java
MobileElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
touchActions.doubleTap(element).perform(); // Double tap on the element
```

- `scroll(PointOption<?> startPoint, PointOption<?> endPoint)`: Simulates a scroll gesture from the start point to the end point.
```java
PointOption<?> startPoint = PointOption.point(100, 200);
PointOption<?> endPoint = PointOption.point(200, 300);
touchActions.scroll(startPoint, endPoint).perform(); // Scroll from (100, 200) to (200, 300)
```

These are just a few examples of the methods available in the `TouchShortcuts` interface. You can explore other methods in the interface based on your specific requirements for touch actions in your Appium tests.
